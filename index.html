                        <p>The therapists at Working Sobriety believe that group psychotherapy is an ideal treatment for addictions and compulsive disorders.  Our staff works together as a group, and we share a commitment to continued training in group psychotherapy, group and organizational dynamics and experience in mutual support groups.

                        <h2>Individual Psychotherapy</h2>
                        <p>Addiction is a disease of isolation.  Recovery from addiction and 
                            compulsive disorders may be supported by individual psychotherapy.  This process begins with consultation to establish a working relationship 
                            between the person who is asking for help and the therapist.  Clinical
                            assessment guides us in offering treatment designed to address the needs of the individual.  Since the staff of Working Sobriety are all experienced in both individual and group psychotherapy, a treatment plan may include a combination of individual and group psychotherapy.  Our staff includes two addiction psychiatrists who may participate in the evaluation process when indicated.</p>

                        <h2>Couples &amp; Family Therapy</h2>
                        <p>Our philosophy is rooted in the belief that addiction is a family disease.  Individuals who seek help for addictions and compulsive behaviors may benefit from their families’ participation in their recovery process.  Families may also find that working on their own difficulties leads to benefits for themselves.
                        The therapists at Working Sobriety are committed to supporting families who wish to join a process of recovery.  We offer couples and family 
                        psychotherapy and intervention for individual families.  Since families, like individuals, recover together         in a community, we also offer Family 
                        Weekends, Couples Workshops and Children’s Workshops &#40;please see Upcoming Events page&#41;.</p>

                        <h2>Pharmacotherapy</h2>
                        <p>Some people who are recovering from addictions and compulsive behaviors benefit from the addition of medication to therapeutic services.When any of our staff believes that medication may be useful,we recommend an evaluation by one of our psychiatrists. This evaluation determines wthether pharmacotherapy would be a usefull addition to the other treatment servisec and whether the use of medication will assist the person in recovery to have greater access to feelings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Those who are recovering from opiate addiction may benefit from 
                        psychotherapy in conjunction with the use of buprenorphine &#40;Suboxone&#41;.  In our experience, combining the use of group psychotherapy with 
                        Suboxone maintenance supports the long term recovery process from opiate addiction.

                        <h2>Advanture-based Groups</h2>
                        <p>Adventure-based Groups involve the use of physically engaging activities designed to foster collaboration among group members as they work toward their collective and individual therapeutic goals. Many of the 
                        activities we employ during adventure-based counseling sessions mirror the general principles of recovery from addiction such as the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
                        </p>

                        <p>We have found that participation in these groups have an opportunity to engage in activities that result in enhanced interpersonal relationships and heightened self-esteem.  We provide a safe and supportive way to meet the need for adventure.
                        We offer adventure-based groups in our Chicago offices, and these groups are also offered in outdoor settings during our annual Family Week and during our intensive workshops and retreats. </p>

                        psycho-educational groups during our annual Family Week and during our intensive individual family programs.  We also offer psycho-educational groups on women’s health issues.
