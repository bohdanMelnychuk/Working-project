                            is an addiction psychiatrist with an extensive background in treating 
                            patients with substance use problems in a variety of clinical settings     for the past fifteen years. Before joining Working Sobriety, he was the training director of an ACGME-accredited addiction psychiatry training program at the University of Louisville, where, along with his teaching duties, he 
                            participated in research funded by the National Institute of Drug Abuse. He is triple boarded in general psychiatry, addiction psychiatry, and 
                            psychosomatic medicine, with additional certification in addiction             medicine and group psychotherapy. He was designated a distinguished fellow by the American Psychiatric Association in 2013. Working with special 
                            populations has always been part of his clinical repertoire, including
                            professionals, veterans, women, patients with co-occurring disorders, and personality disorders,    further informing his individualized and holistic 
                            approach to patients. Dr. Stewart’s philosophy of treatment emphasizes working through unmet attachment needs by integrating twelve step 
                            recovery principles with the interpersonal group psychotherapy model.
